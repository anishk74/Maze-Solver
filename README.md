# Maze-Solver
A Maze Solver based on DFS(Depth-First-Search)

## Description
Implemented a Maze-Solver to extract information from a given maze and transform the maze into a graph. Applied DFS from the start-node to find the path to end node while saving the whole search.

## Building graph from the maze
